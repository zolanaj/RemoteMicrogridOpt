# Remote Microgrid Optimization project repository

## About
This is a private repository containing the python code and working files in support of the following paper:
1. Concurrent Optimization of Capital Cost and Expected O&M (2015-2018)
2. Real-Time Operations Optimization Software (2018-)

The code was written in the CPLEX/Python API, using Python 2.7.9.  Additional python libraries, like SciPy, are used here, and so a Python distribution like Anaconda is recommended.  Anaconda distributions for Python 2 are available here: 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/hashes/win-2-64/

CPLEX distributions may be obtained via the IBM website (free for academics):
